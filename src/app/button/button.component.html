<h1 style="color:blue;">The sky is an unobstructed view upward from the surface of the Earth. It includes the atmosphere
  and outer space. It may also be considered a place between the ground and outer space, thus distinct from outer
  space.

  In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial sphere. This is an abstract sphere, concentric to
  the Earth, on which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting. The celestial sphere is conventionally
  divided into designated areas called constellations.

  Usually, the term sky informally refers to a perspective from the Earth's surface; however, the meaning and usage
  can vary. An observer on the surface of the Earth can see a small part of the sky, which resembles a dome (sometimes
  called the sky bowl) appearing flatter during the day than at night.[1] In some cases, such as in discussing the
  weather, the sky refers to only the lower, denser layers of the atmosphere.</h1>
